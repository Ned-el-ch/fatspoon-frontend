### 
This is an SPA I built to practice using React, Redux, SCSS, and Ruby on Rails (as an API).

Here's a (sort of) full list of the main packages I used to build the frontend
- React-Redux
- Redux-Thunk
- React-Router / -Dom
- React-Bootstrap
- React-Lottie, GSAP, and React-Transition-Group for animations
- React-Select
- SASS/SCSS for custom styling

Other "helper" packages
- Chroma.js
- React-Datepicker
- Redux-Devtools-Extension
- Moment.js for handling dates
- Custom UUID function in lieu of a package for better customisation

# <a name="authors-note"></a> Author's Note
Before I made the app, I used to struggle figuring out what to cook. Since then it grew into a useful tool I use to track what food I have in my house, as well as my dietary intake. Although some bias may exist, my mom has said it made her life a ton easier.
